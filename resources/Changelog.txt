1.1.4 	- Fixed a bug - breaking a log would sometimes drop a bookshelf. Will keep events separated in future.
		- Fixed sapling drops when using clippers on leaves.
		- After much difficulty, apples no longer drop from oak trees.
		- Simplified bookshelf code. No player/tool checks. Simply break and collect.
		- Glass, glass panes (and variants) all drop themselves. Silk Touch pretty much useless now. >:D
		- Obsidian is now a lot weaker and only needs an iron pickaxe. Obsidian furniture can now be collected with stone pickaxes.
		- Removed my Iron Tools (except clippers), as I've discovered a mod - Material Changer - that allows me to edit vanilla/modded tool durability.

1.1.3.3	- Added Quartz Clippers (to replace PrimalCore equivalent).
		- All applicable items/blocks are added to the Ore Dictionary.

1.1.3.2 - Fixed stone brick texture bug (note to self: case sensitivity is important - remember your CAPS people).
		- Added a few zinc/brass related items.

1.1.3.1 - IMPORTANT - Delete your configs! I've made changes to the config file.
		- Replaced tin ore with zinc. (Since my modpack already has tin, but no zinc).
		- Noticed stone bricks aren't displaying textures in my modpack, even though they work in my test environment. -_-

1.1.3	- Added custom tools, based on PrimalCore tools (to fill the gaps in the mod, namely Bronze and Steel).
		- Important: My tools aren't capable of PrimalCore's in-world recipes. PrimalCore's code isn't open source yet.
		- The tools and items are pretty much done now.
		- Re-added tin ore. Fixed typo in code ('pickaxe' instead of 'pick'), and works properly with other mods.

1.1.2	- Added even more items. Should be pretty much all I need now.
		- Added wrought iron tools (since I couldn't figure out how to change vanilla iron tool durability).
		- Wrought iron tools are the same as vanilla tools, but more durable.
		- No wrought iron armour ATM, may consider it if I need it.
		- Fixed glitch in axes not having correct harvest level (bug created after prior axe fix).

1.1.1.2 - Fixed clippers durability (instead of extending ItemShears, I extended ItemTool).
		- Clippers now act as weapons, albeit not very powerful. (Slower than sword, stronger than bare fists).
		- Fixed bronze axe not doing enough damage - code is now correct.
		- Noticed a new bug. Using clippers on leaves will still drop saplings, meaning infinite saplings from a leaf block.
		- Attempted to patch above bug, but no luck. Realised that player would have to waste the clippers durability trying to use this exploit, so not so bad.
		- Fortunately I was able to prevent stick drops when using clippers. So no infinite stick exploit.

1.1.1.1 - Reinstated tools and armour. Tin Ore is still disabled (see below).
		- Noticed my Tin Ore doesn't seem to work properly with Better Beginnings or Fortune Ores - must be glitch in my code.
		- Renamed Shears 'Clippers', and added Flint, Iron and Steel Variants. All will make sheep drop fleece.
		- Noticed a bug - clippers all have the same durability... I'll have to amend this.

1.1.1	- Added a heap of items for the modpack. More to come.

1.1.0.2 - After making some changes to my modpack, almost everything I made in this mod is redundant. -_-
		- Therefore, nearly everything has been disabled. Code has been kept as comments for reference.
		- Basically, only the stone/wood events, and a small number of items remain enabled.
		- Configs do nothing ATM. May restructure configs later and disable things properly.

1.1.0.1 - Added tin to ore dictionary. Disabled by default.
		- Behind the scenes - added a heap of new textures. Not all will be used.

1.1.0  - Added bronze armour.

1.0.9.3 - Finally! Bookshelf drop works correctly. Simply had to rearrange the order of the if statements. *facepalm*

1.0.9.2 - Tweaked bookshelf drop - mod axes should work, but now breaking bookshelf with TNT crashes game.

1.0.9.1 - Made bookshelves drop themselves, provided you use an axe. Code unoptimised - won't work on other mods' axes.

1.0.9 	- Added a config file, so now tin ore generation can be configured.
		- Tweaked tin spawning, now a shallow ore (near surface), thus a bit easier to find

1.0.8.3 - Renamed mod to CalebRatedCore, 'tutorial' was starting to get a bit old.

1.0.8.2 - Fixed stone drop bug. Method should be extendable now.
		- Updated sheep shear code, should only affect entities explicitly dropping wool. Code now correctly formatted. (Cheers Choonster)

1.0.8.1 - Fixed sheep shear bug, shouldn't cause conflicts, unless modded entity drops anything with 'Wool' in the name.
		- Reinstated sheep drop code (for killing sheep); albeit with minor modifications.

1.0.8 	- Altered sheep shear drops. However, code may cause conflict with other mods.

1.0.7.1 - Realised stone drop code was bugged (as in causing crashes bugged), and had to remove it. :(

1.0.7 	- Added custom shears - Bronze Shears. (Thanks Bright_Spark for tip)
		- Tin Oregen currently forced disabled - will re-enable once I have a config file for the mod.
		- Behind the scenes, I've been organising exactly what items/blocks I need for modpack. Work continues.

1.0.6 	- After much effort, added an event to change Vanilla Stone Block to drop itself.
		- Added code to force players to use tools when cutting wooden blocks (Based on Choonster's Test3 mod)
		- Above tweak also adds a chance for sticks to drop from leaves.

1.0.5 	- Added a bunch of standard Bronze tools - Sword, Pickaxe, Axe, Shovel and Hoe.

1.0.4 	- Set up Ore Generation for Tin. Works like a treat.

1.0.3 	- Replaced Manganese with Tin, made Tin Ore Block drop tin.
		- Made a new Item - Interface Screen (doesn't do anything, but will be a component in other things later on).

1.0.2 	- Added Manganese Ore as a block.
		- Played around with mob drops, trying to alter sheep drops, but realised shearing handled differently. Gave up.

1.0.1 	- Added Manganese Item as a test item.

1.0.0 	- Start up, just getting mod environment sorted. Which is an ordeal in itself.
